# Flask Api Starter Kit [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dajuguan/arxanapi/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/antkahn/flask-api-starter-kit/tree/master) [![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/antkahn/flask-api-starter-kit/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/antkahn/flask-api-starter-kit/?branch=master)

This starter kit is designed to allow you to create very fast your Flask API.

The primary goal of this project is to remain as **unopinionated** as possible. Its purpose is not to dictate your project structure or to demonstrate a complete sample application, but to provide a set of tools intended to make back-end development robust, easy, and, most importantly, fun.

This starter kit comes with a [tutorial](https://github.com/dajuguan/arxanapi/blob/tutorial/doc/installation.md).
Check it out if you want a quick tutorial on how to use Flask with this architecure.

## Dependencies

You will need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Getting Started

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dajuguan/arxanapi <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```


Then install dependencies and check that it works

```bash
$ make install      # Install the pip dependencies on the docker container
$ make start        # Run the container containing your local python server
```
If everything works, you should see the available routes [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/application/spec),会看到如下结果:
```
{
  "definitions": {},
  "info": {
    "description": "API description",
    "termsOfService": "Terms of service",
    "title": "Application",
    "version": "0.0.1"
  },
  "paths": {
    "/api/user/{last_name}/{first_name}": {
      "get": {
          ...
          ...
             }
  },
  "swagger": "2.0"
}
```

访问[here](http://0.0.0.0:3000/api/user/testfirstname/testlastname)应该会看到
```
{
  "user": {
    "name": "chen"
  }
}
```
这个结果

The API runs locally on docker containers. You can easily change the python version you are willing to use [here](https://github.com/dajuguan/arxanapi/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L4), by fetching a docker image of the python version you want.


## 项目结构及编写方法
1.采用的是docker镜像，docker内部装的是python3.4版本(如果没有docker-compose会安装不上)
2.make start 执行的是/src/server.py，修改代码保存后会自动重启
3.日志采用logging模块，书写格式见server.py
```
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.debug("ENV debug=%s,server is listening at %s: %s" % (config.DEBUG,config.HOST,config.PORT))
```
4.路由模块在routes文件夹配置,比如里面有user.py，需要在该文件夹下的__init__.py中加入
```
from .user import USER_BLUEPRINT
```
5.具体的routes里的详细get，post等操作在相应的resources文件夹下书写，同样也需要在resources文件夹下__init__.py中引入相应的文件。
采用json格式输出


## Commands

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `make start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`make <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`install`|Install the pip dependencies on the server's container.|
|`start`|Run your local server in its own docker container.|
|`daemon`|Run your local server in its own docker container as a daemon.|
|`db/connect`|Connect to your docker database.|
|`db/migrate`|Generate a database migration file using alembic, based on your model files.|
|`db/upgrade`|Run the migrations until your database is up to date.|
|`db/downgrade`|Downgrade your database by one migration.|
|`tests`|Run unit tests with unittest in its own container.|
|`lint`|Run flake8 on the `src` directory.|

## Database(这一部分暂时不涉及，先不用管)

The database is in [PostgreSql](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Locally, you can connect to your database using :
```bash
$ make db/connect
```

However, you will need before using this command to change the docker database container's name [here](https://github.com/dajuguan/arxanapi/blob/master/package.json#L6).

This kit contains a built in database versioning using [alembic](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/alembic).
Once you've changed your models, which should reflect your database's state, you can generate the migration, then upgrade or downgrade your database as you want. See [Commands](#commands) for more information.

The migration will be generated by the container, it may possible that you can only edit it via `sudo` or by running `chown` on the generated file.

## Application Structure

The application structure presented in this boilerplate is grouped primarily by file type. Please note, however, that this structure is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive.

```

└── test                     # Unit tests source code
```

## Development

To develop locally, here are your two options:

```bash
$ make start           # Create the containers containing your python server in your terminal
$ make daemon          # Create the containers containing your python server as a daemon
```

The containers will reload by themselves as your source code is changed.
You can check the logs in the `./server.log` file.

## Testing

To add a unit test, simply create a `test_*.py` file anywhere in `./test/`, prefix your test classes with `Test` and your testing methods with `test_`. Unittest will run them automaticaly.
You can add objects in your database that will only be used in your tests, see example.
You can run your tests in their own container with the command:

```bash
$ make tests
```

## Lint

To lint your code using flake8, just run in your terminal:

```bash
$ make lint
```

It will run the flake8 commands on your project in your server container, and display any lint error you may have in your code.

## Swagger

Your API needs a description of it's routes and how to interact with them.
You can easily do that with the swagger package included in the starter kit.
Simply add a docstring to the resources of your API like in the `user` example.
The API description will be available [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/application/spec).
